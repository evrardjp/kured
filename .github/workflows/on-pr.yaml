  # This ensures the latest code works with the manifests built from tree.
  # It is useful for two things:
  # - Test manifests changes (obviously), ensuring they don't break existing clusters
  # - Ensure manifests work with the latest versions even with no manifest change
  #     (compared to helm charts, manifests cannot easily template changes based on versions)
  # Helm charts are _trailing_ releases, while manifests are done during development.
  # This test uses the "command" reboot-method.
